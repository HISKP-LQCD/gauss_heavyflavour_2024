In many precision tests of the Standard Model (SM) of Particle Physics and
searches for New Physics beyond it, a precise understanding of hadron
structure and interactions is needed to provide ab initio predictions
to be compared with experimental data. The fundamental forces of Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD) at low energy describe particles, namely mesons and
baryons, as the non-perturbative realisation of confined quarks interacting
via gluons. The only rigorous treatment of such non-perturbative
dynamics known to date is based on the regularisation of the theory on
a finite, discrete Euclidean space-time lattice, and subsequent
numerical simulations of the discretized theory. This allows one to
compute hadronic matrix elements of great phenomenological interest,
such as e.g those regulating hadron structure and fragmentation, decays and transition
amplitudes among different flavours of hadrons, and hadronic corrections
to electroweak precision observables.
%affecting precision observables, among others.

Flavour physics is currently one of the fields with a high potential
for the discovery of a statistically significant discrepancy between the SM and
experiment. Among others, there could be additional flavour-changing
interactions, further complex phases in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)
matrix, or possible violations 
of lepton-flavour universality. Even if the mass scales of new
particles beyond the SM turned out to be very high, quantum effects of
the associated fields could leave detectable imprints onto the physics
of heavy quarks.
This makes precise theoretical computations of related observables
highly desirable. In particular, semi-leptonic decays of heavy mesons
and elements of the CKM matrix are very
interesting to estimate accurately from first principles.

Until recently, most lattice calculations focused on the investigation
of exclusive decays due to the fact that inclusive processes consist
of a potentially very large number of physical states and their
systematic analysis in lattice QCD calculations was impractical.  
However, novel approaches have been put forward that allow one to address
inclusive decays in lattice QCD, like the method described in 
Ref.~\cite{Gambino:2020crt} where the total decay rate for the process
$D_s \to X\ell\nu$ is related to a smeared spectral density that can
be computed from an Euclidean four-point function in a finite
volume~\cite{Hansen:2019idp} (see
also \cite{Bulava:2019kbi,Bulava:2021fre}). The computation of such
Euclidean correlation functions is standard and can be carried out
with high precision. Then, the reconstruction of the spectral densities
represents the main challenge. Feasibility studies of this
method are highly encouraging~\cite{Gambino:2022dvu}.

With this computer time application, we propose the calculation of the total
decay rate for the process $D_s \to X\ell\nu$ including the continuum
limit using the $N_f=2+1+1$ clover twisted-mass action with physical
values of up/down, strange and charm
quarks~\cite{ExtendedTwistedMass:2021qui,ExtendedTwistedMass:2021gbo,ExtendedTwistedMass:2022jpw}.
This will allow us, at the same time, to also compute high precision
estimates of the decay constants of $D$ and $D_s$ mesons needed to
perform unitarity checks for the first and second rows of the CKM matrix.

Beyond the computation of the matrix elements, this project will
in addition provide the necessary background to extend these
calculations to the $B$ meson, where, on the experimental side, recent
results from $B$ factories reveal some tension with 
SM predictions, but also exhibit puzzling discrepancies between exclusive and inclusive
channels~\cite{ParticleDataGroup:2020ssz, HFLAV:2019otj, Gambino:2019sif}

%The theoretical study of semileptonic decays of heavy mesons encode direct information on the modulus of the elements of the
%Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark mixing matrix \cite{Cabibbo:1963yz, Kobayashi:1973fv}. 
%By using the optical theorem, the total inclusive decay rate for the process $D_s \to X\ell\nu$ can be written
%$|V_{cd}|$, $|V_{cs}|$ and $|V_{us}|$
%\begin{equation}
%	\Gamma = G^2_F\left\{ |V_{cd} |^2 \Gamma_{cd} + |V_{cs} |^2 \Gamma_{cs} + |V_{us} |^2 \Gamma_{su}
