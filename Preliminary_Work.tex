The proposed project aims to continue the long term activities of the
Extended Twisted Mass Collaboration (ETMC) in the calculation of
hadronic matrix elements via lattice QCD simulations. ETMC has
produced and is still producing gauge configuration ensembles at
different lattice spacing values at the physical point, by which we
mean physical values of all the dynamical quark masses. For the
proposal here we propose to use four values of the lattice spacing,
corresponding to the ensembles compiled in Table~\ref{tab:ensembles}. The
ensembles labelled with $B$, $C$ and $D$ have been produced already
and used in several ETMC
works~\cite{ExtendedTwistedMass:2021qui,ExtendedTwistedMass:2021gbo,ExtendedTwistedMass:2022jpw,ExtendedTwistedMassCollaborationETMC:2022sta}.
The ensemble labelled as $Ap$ is currently being produced, and
will be available end of the year.
These four lattice spacing values will enable a controlled continuum
limit of the quantities relevant to this proposal.
Moreover, at the $B$ and $C$ values of the lattice spacing we have
larger volumes available, which will allow us to check finite volume
effects representing a main source of systematic uncertainty.
Since we work directly at physical light quark mass values, no
extrapolation in the light quark mass values is necessary.

For the continuum limit we additionally benefit from automatic
$\mathcal{O}(a)$-improvement of the physical observables in question thanks to the twisted mass action at
maximal twist, ensuring convergence to the continuum
limit with scaling violations of order $a^2$~\cite{Frezzotti:2003ni}.

In addition to the feasibility study presented by the authors of
Ref.~\cite{Gambino:2022dvu} including some of the project contributors of this
project, we have performed a first exploratory investigation of
charm-down quark part of the
differential decay rate of the $D_s$ meson decaying into $X\ell\nu$ on
the cB211.072.64 ensemble, for the first time at the physical
point. The result is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Gamma_B64}. We will
explain the details below, but the important lessons from this figure
are the following: i) the statistical uncertainty can be controlled,
ii) large enough separations in time can be achieved, and iii) the
dependence on the squared momentum can be resolved. This makes us
confident that the proposed project is feasible.

Regarding the determination of the decay constants $f_{D}$ and
$f_{D_s}$, a preliminary study is available in
Ref.~\cite{Dimopoulos:2021qsf}. We will extend this calculation by
including an additional lattice spacing value (the cD
ensemble) as well as by increasing statistics. This will allow us to
determine the decay constants with competitive statistics compared to
other lattice collaborations.
