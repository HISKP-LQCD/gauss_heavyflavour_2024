The proposers have extensive and long standing experience in high
performance computing using vector and massively parallel
supercomputers such as the CRAY T3E, PC-Cluster systems, APE, IBM
Blue Gene, Intel Xeon Scalable and Intel Knight's Landing machines as well
as machines equipped with GPU-based accelerators.
Our group includes algorithm experts who have been involved over many years in
developing efficient implementations of dynamical fermion algorithms.

\noindent\textbf{Carsten Urbach (PI)} is professor at the University
of Bonn. He has pioneered simulation methods in lattice QCD applying
mass preconditioning and multiple timescale integration schemes and
flavour singlet calculations. He is and has been managing Gauss
project allocations at JSC and LRZ and he is principal investigator in
two DFG funded collaborative research centres.\\
\noindent\textbf{Roberto Frezzotti} is professor of physics at the
University of Rome II. He is one of the fathers of Wilson twisted mass
lattice QCD and the key feature of automatic improvement at maximal
twist.\\ 
\noindent\textbf{Nazario Tantalo} is professor of physics at the
University of Rome II. He is one of the developers of the spectral
reconstruction method, which is key to this proposal.
